## What This Project Is

`photonic-workflow` is an installable local runtime and agent skill for
auditable photonic-integrated-circuit design closure. It connects design
intent, component and compact-model contracts, complex S-parameter circuits,
layout/netlist comparisons, bounded solver plans, optimization, packaging,
tapeout, measurement, provenance, and evidence gates.

The repository retains its historical COMSOL-oriented name, but the runtime is
solver-agnostic. COMSOL, MATLAB, Lumerical, layout/PDK tools, instruments, and
remote services are bounded adapters; this project does not replace an
electromagnetic solver, foundry signoff, calibrated measurement, or engineering
judgment.

Use an `advisory` path for explanation, planning, read-only diagnosis, and
preliminary screening without creating or advancing a gate ledger. Use the
`evidence` path for solver execution, reusable model qualification, claim
promotion, optimization winners, handoff, publication, tapeout, or measurement.
Successful execution and physical acceptance remain separate in both paths.

## Showcase: Prompt-to-COMSOL SOI Euler 50:50 Splitter

This public-safe test case shows how the skill turns a natural-language request
into an auditable COMSOL model, a coupling-length screen, a fine-mesh result,
and field-image checks. The design is an SOI-based four-port evanescent
directional coupler at 1550 nm. Eight solid Euler interpolation curves route
the 500 nm waveguides into and out of a 200 nm gap; every bend has a 30 degree
turn and a 5.0 um minimum radius.

| Test item | Value |
|---|---|
| Model | `GPT-5.6sol high` |
| Skill | `$photonic-waveguide-optics` |
| Solver | COMSOL Multiphysics 6.4.0.293, Electromagnetic Waves, Frequency Domain |
| Platform | 220 nm SOI context; 2D effective-index model (EIM) |
| Wavelength | 1550 nm |
| Selected coupling geometry | 0.20 um edge-to-edge gap; 2.50 um parallel coupling length |
| Evidence level | Preliminary fine-mesh 2D EIM result at one wavelength |

The original test prompt is reproduced verbatim. The local skill path is part
of that prompt; readers should replace it with their own installation path.

### Field result

| Linear field, `ewfd.normE^2` | Log field, normalized `10 log10` scale |
|---|---|
| ![Linear electric-field intensity for the SOI Euler directional coupler](docs/images/showcase/soi-euler-50-50/field-linear.png) | ![Log-scale electric-field intensity for the SOI Euler directional coupler](docs/images/showcase/soi-euler-50-50/field-log.png) |

The linear view shows the upper-port excitation coupling into two guided
outputs. The log view exposes weak background radiation and was checked against
the explicitly integrated open-boundary flux; it is not used by itself as proof
of device qualification.

### Final fine-mesh result

| Metric | Result |
|---|---:|
| P3 transmission, `T31` | 0.485296 |
| P4 transmission, `T41` | 0.513588 |
| Collected-output split | 48.5839% / 51.4161% |
| Collected power, `T31 + T41` | 0.998884 |
| Collected excess loss | 0.00485 dB |
| Input reflection, `R11` | 5.15e-6 (about -52.88 dB) |
| Open-boundary outward flux | 0.001112 W/m (about 0.111% of input power per metre) |
| Port-mode effective index | 2.22879723 |
| Mesh / frequency-domain DOF | 558,912 triangles / 3,913,885 DOF |

The 2.50 um result meets this test's 50:50 +/- 2 percentage-point acceptance
target. A coarse-to-fine mesh comparison changed the collected upper fraction
by only 0.00327 percentage points.

### Coupling-length screen at 1550 nm

| Coupling length (um) | `T31` | `T41` | Collected upper fraction | `T31 + T41` |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1.0 | 0.673455 | 0.325021 | 0.674483 | 0.998476 |
| 2.5, coarse | 0.485277 | 0.513634 | 0.485806 | 0.998911 |
| 4.0 | 0.299400 | 0.699629 | 0.299691 | 0.999029 |
| 10.0 | 0.035454 | 0.963388 | 0.035495 | 0.998842 |

The monotonic transfer from P3 to P4 is consistent with evanescent directional
coupling. The workflow first froze the device contract and acceptance rule,
qualified a straight-waveguide/numerical-port baseline, checked disjoint and
complete port/open-boundary selections, screened coupling length, reran the
selected design on a finer mesh, and audited both field views and power
bookkeeping.

## What Version 0.4.0 Provides

| Surface | Current role |
|---|---|
| Installable core | Click CLI, Pydantic contracts, NumPy circuit composition, project configuration, run store, provenance, artifact audit, and G0-G8/M0-M4 ledgers |
| PIC and PDK contracts | Design intent, devices, ports, components, netlists, layouts, PDK/technology/corner models, model cards, packaging, test, tapeout, and measurement records |
| Circuit compatibility | Legacy `assembly.json` 1.0 and long-form complex S-parameter CSV validation/composition |
| Reusable modeling recipes | Versioned, fail-closed circular/Euler geometry, segmented port windows, bulk material dispersion, and common-basis two-port diagnostics distilled from reviewed LT-aMZI workflows |
| External backends | Capability probes and bounded plans; commercial execution remains separately authorized and test-gated |
| MATLAB | Phase A check, inventory, plan, controlled-wrapper, result, and Engine-probe surfaces; real local smoke belongs to Phase B |
| MCP | Dependency-light stdio JSON-RPC transport whose manifest enumerates all registered skill resources and 10 narrow tools; no solver, MATLAB, instrument, or arbitrary-shell execution |
| Legacy entry points | Existing Python and PowerShell commands remain compatibility entry points while package-service parity is regression-tested |
| Research record | Official/project-maintained source surveys for PIC and MATLAB tools with explicit local and physics verification boundaries |

Implementation and local availability are reported separately:

- implementation: `implemented`, `experimental`, `planned`, or `unverified`;
- availability: `available`, `unavailable`, `incompatible`, or `unverified`.

Neither field is a device gate. Only inspected evidence can change a G or M
gate.

## Install

Python 3.11 or newer is required. Install the solver-independent core from a
reviewed checkout:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Bian-M-X/comsol-photonic-waveguide-optics-skill.git
Set-Location .\comsol-photonic-waveguide-optics-skill

python -m pip install -e .
photonic --version
```

The core installs only Click, Pydantic, and NumPy. Optional extras describe
integration families; they do not download commercial products, licenses,
PDKs, MATLAB toolboxes, or instruments:

```powershell
python -m pip install -e ".[layout,circuit,sparams]"
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Install optional dependencies only for an approved local workflow and review
their licenses independently. The `all` extra intentionally includes only
redistributable Python packages listed in `pyproject.toml`; it is not a
complete PIC environment.

To install the Codex skill itself, place this repository under a discovered
skills directory such as:

```powershell
$SkillRoot = Join-Path $env:USERPROFILE '.codex\skills\photonic-waveguide-optics'
git clone https://github.com/Bian-M-X/comsol-photonic-waveguide-optics-skill.git $SkillRoot
```

Restart Codex or open a new task after changing skill discovery locations.

## Five-Minute Solver-Free Start

Create an MZI project, validate it, and inspect its fail-closed status:

```powershell
$ProjectRoot = Join-Path $env:TEMP 'photonic-mzi-demo'

photonic init $ProjectRoot --device-family mzi --json
photonic check --project-root $ProjectRoot --json
photonic circuit validate "$ProjectRoot\circuits\assembly.json" --json
photonic circuit compose "$ProjectRoot\circuits\assembly.json" `
  --output "$ProjectRoot\data\processed\circuit_sparameters.csv" `
  --summary "$ProjectRoot\verification\circuit_summary.json" `
  --json
photonic status --project-root $ProjectRoot --json
```

The bundled fixtures are deterministic analytic examples. They exercise
contracts and network composition; they are not a qualified PDK, fabricated
device, or full-wave validation.

Available initialization profiles are:

- `pdk-first`;
- `layout-first`;
- `custom-device-first`;
- `matlab-legacy-layout`;
- `matlab-assisted-design`.

`photonic.toml` records runtime policy and aliases. Physical geometry,
materials, modes, topology, boundary conditions, objectives, and acceptance
thresholds belong in versioned design and run contracts.

## CLI Map

Run `photonic <group> --help` for the authoritative command schema.

| Area | Command groups |
|---|---|
| Project and recovery | `init`, `check`, `doctor`, `status`, `inspect`, `report` |
| PDK and device data | `pdk`, `component`, `model`, `sparams`, `variation` |
| Reusable modeling | `recipe list`, `recipe inspect`, `recipe render` |
| Circuit and layout | `circuit`, `netlist`, `layout` |
| External planning | `solver`, `matlab` |
| Campaigns and release | `optimize`, `package`, `testplan`, `tapeout`, `measurement` |
| Evidence and security | `gate`, `audit` |

Backend readiness is deliberately separate from device evidence. Initialize,
inspect, and evaluate one backend record at a time:

```powershell
photonic gate adoption list --project-root . --json
photonic gate adoption init matlab-runtime --project-root . --dry-run --json
photonic gate adoption init matlab-runtime --project-root . --json
photonic gate adoption inspect matlab-runtime --project-root . --json
photonic gate adoption record matlab-runtime capability-probe blocked `
  --reason "normal interactive-user probe is pending" `
  --project-root . --json
photonic gate adoption evaluate matlab-runtime --project-root . --json
```

Records live under `verification/adoption/`. Initialization never overwrites an
existing record, and `--dry-run` performs no writes. Pass/fail evidence supplied
to the CLI must be a readable project-relative file; a nonblank reference alone
is not accepted as proof.

JSON responses use a stable envelope with command, status, exit code, data,
warnings, and errors. Important exit codes are:

| Code | Meaning |
|---:|---|
| 0 | success |
| 1 | internal or unclassified failure |
| 2 | invalid input |
| 3 | unavailable capability |
| 4 | incompatible version |
| 5 | execution failure |
| 6 | acceptance rejected |
| 7 | security violation |
| 8 | timeout |

A read-only status command may return code 0 while every evidence gate remains
`blocked`. Execution success and physical acceptance are independent states.

### Reusable Modeling Recipes

The built-in recipe registry turns reviewed LT-aMZI modeling primitives into
stable, inspectable calls without copying project-specific models or claiming
solver acceptance:

```powershell
photonic recipe list --json
photonic recipe inspect geometry.symmetric-euler-bend --json
photonic recipe render geometry.symmetric-euler-bend `
  --input .\examples\recipes\symmetric-euler-bend.json `
  --renderer canonical-json `
  --json
```

Each recipe uses an exact semantic version, explicit units, strict input
validation, deterministic output, and packaged provenance. Only the allowlisted
geometry/port recipes can emit bounded COMSOL Java fragments; rendering is not
solver execution or physics evidence. Each Java fragment also requires an
explicit safe `--instance-id` so multiple MZI arms/routes can coexist without
feature-tag collisions. See `references/modeling-recipes.md`.

## Modeling and Evidence Workflow

Use the lowest-cost model that can answer the declared question:

```text
design intent and claim
  -> straight-waveguide and port baseline
  -> independently qualified component models
  -> complete complex multiport S data
  -> validated circuit and sensitivity
  -> port-aware layout and extracted connectivity
  -> selected promoted full-wave checks
  -> robustness and evidence package
  -> test readiness, measurement, correlation, recalibration
```

G0-G8 track design through evidence packaging. M0-M4 are a separate
post-fabrication track:

| Gate | Required evidence |
|---|---|
| `G0` | Device contract and intended claim |
| `G1` | Port and straight-waveguide baseline |
| `G2` | Component qualification |
| `G3` | Assembly contract |
| `G4` | Circuit behavior |
| `G5` | Layout and connectivity |
| `G6` | Promoted full-wave subassembly |
| `G7` | Robustness and optimization |
| `G8` | Reproducible evidence package |
| `M0` | Test readiness |
| `M1` | Raw-data integrity |
| `M2` | Calibrated measurement |
| `M3` | Simulation/measurement correlation |
| `M4` | Compact-model recalibration |

Missing evidence is `blocked`, not pass. A gate pass requires explicit evidence.

## Phase Boundaries

The phase labels describe integration maturity, not device acceptance:

- **Phase A — reliable local core:** installable package, contracts, safe
  plans, mock fixtures, run recovery, gates, legacy parity, MATLAB
  check/plan surfaces, thin MCP, and public-CI-safe tests.
- **Phase B — authorized local validation:** licensed `matlab -batch` and
  `matlab.unittest` smoke, optional Engine checks, data round trips, legacy
  layout/FDFD/RF fixtures, and local numerical parity.
- **Phase C — bounded external integrations:** COMSOL LiveLink, Lumerical,
  instruments, Simulink, commercial PDK/tapeout, packaging/test execution,
  measurement correlation, and large or remote optimization after
  backend-specific adoption gates.

Files, descriptors, schemas, product listings, imports, and dry-run plans do
not prove Phase B/C execution. A MATLAB FDFD result is not 3D full-wave
evidence; generated GDS is not foundry DRC signoff; solver convergence is not
measurement correlation.

## MATLAB

MATLAB is optional. The default controlled route is `matlab -batch`; MATLAB
Engine is an optional probe and low-latency route, not the workflow authority.

```powershell
photonic matlab check --json
photonic matlab doctor --json
photonic matlab products --json
photonic matlab toolboxes --json
photonic matlab sessions --json
photonic matlab plan .\runs\example\run_spec.json --project-root . --json
```

Phase A planning accepts only registered entrypoint IDs and constructs argument
arrays around fixed repository-owned MATLAB functions. It does not accept
arbitrary MATLAB code. An absent executable must be reported as structured
`unavailable`; an importable Engine package does not prove a compatible,
licensed, trusted session.

In the Phase A runtime, `matlab run` without `--execute` is another planning
surface; real execution and `matlab test` remain fail-closed Phase B hooks.
When a later version enables an explicitly authorized local Phase B
validation, record MATLAB release, product/toolbox inventory, wrapper and input
hashes, result manifest, expected artifacts, tolerance, and claim limits.
LiveLink, Lumerical, instrument, Simulink, and real tapeout workflows remain
Phase C until their own adoption gates pass.

See `docs/architecture/matlab-integration.md`,
`docs/architecture/matlab-security.md`, and
`docs/research/matlab-tool-landscape.md`.

## COMSOL and Other Solvers

Provide your own compatible, licensed installation. The trusted legacy COMSOL
execution path remains the bounded Java API plus batch runner:

```powershell
$env:PHOTONIC_SOLVER_ROOT = 'C:\Path\To\LicensedSolverRoot'

.\scripts\invoke-waveguide-java-batch.ps1 `
  -SolverRoot $env:PHOTONIC_SOLVER_ROOT `
  -JavaFile 'C:\Path\To\ModelSource.java' `
  -OutputFile 'C:\Path\To\OutputModel.mph' `
  -BatchLog 'C:\Path\To\BatchLog.log' `
  -DryRun
```

Review paths, selections, study order, cost, concurrency, expected outputs, and
claim level before removing `-DryRun`. A rendered solver plan is provenance
support, not solver execution or physics evidence.

The official-source tool surveys in `docs/research/tool-landscape.md` and
`docs/research/matlab-tool-landscape.md` distinguish documented capability from
local availability and verified physics.

## MCP Surface

`scripts/mcp_photonic_server.py` is a compatibility launcher for the package
transport. The current version exposes:

- resources declared by one authoritative registry: one server manifest, every
  registered reference document, and every bounded agent role contract;
- 10 tools: `list_allowed_roots`, `create_project_scaffold`,
  `audit_project_artifacts`, `parse_sweep_table`, `validate_contract`,
  `inspect_project`, `validate_circuit`, `compose_circuit`, `gate_status`, and
  the compatibility-named `run_java_batch`.

`run_java_batch` renders a redacted dry-run plan only. MCP never exposes
arbitrary shell/Python/MATLAB execution or real solver/instrument execution.
Read roots and write roots are separate; write operations fail when no writable
root is configured. Installed wheels carry a read-only mirror of all MCP
reference and agent resources, so `photonic-mcp` does not depend on the current
working directory or a source checkout. `PHOTONIC_SKILL_ROOT` remains an
explicit override for a reviewed skill tree.

See `references/comsol-mcp-evaluation.md` for the adoption boundary.

## Legacy Compatibility

Existing interfaces remain supported while business logic moves into the
package:

- `scripts/photonic_assembly.py validate|compose`;
- `scripts/parse-comsol-sweep.py`;
- `scripts/new-photonic-project.ps1`;
- `scripts/audit-simulation-artifacts.ps1`;
- `scripts/invoke-waveguide-java-batch.ps1`;
- `scripts/mcp_photonic_server.py`.

The v1 assembly schema, port order, model-level vocabulary, exact wavelength
grid, long-form complex CSV columns, and six-column composed output remain
compatibility contracts. See `docs/migration.md` before changing an existing
project.

## Validate a Checkout

The public core validation deliberately requires no MATLAB, COMSOL, Lumerical,
commercial PDK, instrument, network API, or cloud account:

```powershell
python -m pip install -e '.[dev]'

python -B -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*.py'
python -B .\scripts\update_contract_surface_snapshot.py
python -B .\scripts\test_photonic_assembly.py
python -B .\scripts\test_numeric_tools.py
python -B .\scripts\test_mcp_photonic_server.py
python -B .\scripts\test_skill_metadata.py
.\scripts\test_powershell_safety.ps1
.\scripts\sync-packaged-skill-resources.ps1
.\scripts\sync-packaged-matlab-resources.ps1
ruff check src tests scripts

photonic --version
photonic audit artifacts . --fail-on-issues --json
git diff --check
```

Before committing a new package surface, stage the intended files and run
`git diff --cached --check`; after committing, run `git show --check --oneline
HEAD`. Plain `git diff --check` does not inspect untracked files.

CI also enforces Ruff and skill metadata schemas, runs the full Windows suite
on Python 3.11-3.14, runs
portable-core tests on Ubuntu and macOS, builds the sdist and wheel, installs
the wheel into a clean environment outside the checkout, reads all MCP
resources, validates packaged templates, and runs `pip check`. A version tag
triggers a fresh release build, SHA-256 inventory, and GitHub build-provenance
attestations. See `docs/maintenance.md` for the release sequence.

When the Codex `skill-creator` validation script and PyYAML are available in
the selected environment, also run:

```powershell
python "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\skills\.system\skill-creator\scripts\quick_validate.py" .
```

Do not install or mutate a global Python environment merely to make an optional
validator available.
